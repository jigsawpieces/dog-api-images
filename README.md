# Dog API Images

This is the collection of all images served by [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) sorted by breed.

If you would like to contribute towards this open source project with pictures of your own dog, submit your image as a Pull Request and we will review.

All images you submit will be made available via the [Dog API endpoints](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation).

## Submission guide

- We will only accept JPG images which are smaller than 300kb
- Please ensure your photos are of a good quality and the dog is easily identifiable in the photo
- Please ensure your photo features one dog only (although additional dogs can be in the background)
- Photos must not represent any human, even human body parts; it's illegal in most states of the world
- If your dog breed does not exist in our collection you can suggest breeds for us to include by creating a new directory for it
- We love mixed breeds too! They can be included under [/mix](https://github.com/jigsawpieces/dog-api-images/tree/main/mix)
